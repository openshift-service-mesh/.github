    title: Enable CA Bundle injection in only Gateway Namespaces (#335)
    author: Aslak Knutsen
    date: 2025-04-04 13:45:17 +0200
    comment: No direct upstream PR. This feature is a temp fix for the Ingress Team to avoid installing certs into every namespace in the cluster even if there are no Gateways or istio related resources there. This PR can be removed when the upstream Kubernetes API ClusterTrustBundle is out of alpha/beta and we/customers have migrated to use it. Time frame semi unknown(6 months+). (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#cluster-trust-bundles)
